# Hey Readers!

Hey everyone, its been 3 weeks this time! We would have released this blog post last week but I had graduation! Yep, finally graduated from University, which means I have started and finished a masters degree in before this project has finished, which is... humbling. But we don't count the first 2 years anyways...

    </div>
</div>

That's lil old me standing akwardly alone (taken by my girlfriend my family was there don't worry), but I can finally say I have a masters in computer science! Hopefully that translates to better code for the game!

As for the state of development, we are well underway in the "GAME DESIGN" stage of things. The past 4 years have been a botched 1st draft, and now we are tightening things, fixing bugs and for the most part simplifying a lot of the games mechanics. Turns out realism doesn't make for good game design, which was a something we didn't quite understand, and has lead us down question design decisions. But these mistakes exist no more! This week will cover the rewrite of the power and fluid system. The two systems we never said would need a rewrite, suprise suprise, needed a rewrite. But luckily it was terribly quick since it was a lot simpler than the original.

On to the news!

# New Architect Menu

The architect menu has gone under a complete redesign, formerly a really bulky menu that just got in the way, now leaves a lot more screen space. This definitely makes building a much more pleasureable experience, especially without the need of scrolling through the menu to find what you need!

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/newarchitect.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

In the screenshot above you'll also notice blueprints! Which is another new addition. Blueprints are pretty self explanatory; they help you plan out your site before you start committing to building things. Heres the old one for reference.

<div style="display:flex">

        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/oldarchitect.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

I think we can all agree the redesign is a lot better! The architect menu is now a "Deep Menu" which is a term we use for menus that drastically change the interface.

# Fluid and Power System Redesign

This is the two thirds of the big redesign of the logistical systems of Containcorp. The last third is refactoring walls and floors to be voxels instead of entities, but we'll get onto that. The first question you may ask is why did we decide to redesign these 2 elementary systems at such a late stage in development when they were supposedly already finished and polished and ready. Well, they were not finsihed and polished and ready! We built these systems of flawed design, and thus they must die and be replaced by something better, simplier and well... better.

The problem with the previous interation is that every pipe/wire was it's own entity. Which did wonders for saving and loading save files. This was also a problem with walls and floors too! Every wall and floor was its own seperate entity, which as you can imagine was not a good use of resources. This was something we'd knew we'd eventually have to fix, but we pushed it to our "future selves" well, the future is here and its looking bright!

## From Entities To Voxels

Walls and Floors are no longer entities, but, taking a not from minecraft, are now voxels. This makes them use a more data oriented approach, which lends itself to being incredibly performant. A must if we want players to build infinitely up and down in the game. Of course, the game isn't perfectly optimised so the floors will be limited to some number, but optimisation doesn't harm a game. When that optimisation means the difference between 10 fps or 70 fps on just *one* floor, then its worth taking. The main issue transferring to voxels fixed was actually save file saving and loading time, and ultimately the file sizes themselves. AS you can imagine saving each entity seperately with its own data makes for a lot of files! We'll optimise the saving of entities later on, but there was just no need for every wall and floor to be an seperate entity.

With this fundamental change, the power and fluid systems had to be rewritten. It's something that has been at the back of my mind since we started getting the logistics into shape. The design never felt right, it was always incredibly clunky to build any sort of power generation set up or working with pipes. Power was especially bad since we had so many different mechanics we *thought* were cool, but were really just unnecessary complexity and design bloat.

All that's been cut out! So without further ado, I'll just start with showing off the new systems.

## New Power System

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/gen.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

The screenshot above shows the deisel generator and if you look closely you might be able to make out the power cable coming out of it to the right. IF we go into logistics view you should get a clearer picture whats happening.

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/gen-util.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

But its all grayed out, so what's happening? Wheres the power? Well diesel generators need to be fueled!

After its fueled, then its just about placing the cables throughout your facilitly to power everything you want. It's pretty simple, which if you have been following the blogs is a massive reduction in what used to be a mess of transforming between 3 useless power types, and placing 5 objects down just to get things powered in a basic way. Why on earth did we think the game needed power poles? Because Factorio did it. But our game isn't factorio!

Appliances are powered quite simply through smaller cables.

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/appliances.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

Appliances currently take a fixed amount from power grids, meaning grids have a max number of appliances (given the same wattage) they can hold before any new appliances have no power. This is different to how it used to work where all appliances shared power, but only because we wanted to get this feature done rapidly (as it was a rewrite which we don't exactly have much time for). We will however, later tweak this so appliances share power on a network, as that leads to more intuition, and also cool things like lights not having power and flickering/losing their light radius etc.

In my efforts, I also added a new way of producing power. A renewable energy source in fact! Solar energy!

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/solarpanels.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

Neat stuff! Their energy output varies on the time of day, as expected. When we start working on a weather system post alpha, it'll additionally get affect by cloud cover too. Batteries and lights still operate the same as they used too, so not worth a mention here.

## New Fluid System

Pipes have had a total revamp too. Spritewise the pipes look a lot more pleasing to the eye. Below is the basic setup for sourcing water. A water well and a pipeline leading from it. 

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/water-source.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

A water well is all that is needed to source water. Again, very simple! This is in constrast to the mess of pipes and the terrible water purification plant that was needed prior.

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/pipemess.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

Phew! Glad thats gone! As for the different functions you can add to your pipelines, I reimplemented pumps and fluid tanks and added a new object: boilers. Which you can see below.

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/allpipestuff.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

As for how pipes work generally, fluid in pipes is no longer accurate. Before pipes used to hold discrete measurements in litres. Now pipes either *have* fluid or don't. The fluid's within the pipes transfer to each other instantly every tick. Pipes then have a pressure value that decreases from a source object until it is 0, giving pipes a flow range. Thats it really. Theres a few other things like pressure decreasing passibely, along with temperature, but these are just all addons to the basic pressure flow system Funnily enough both of these refactors is back to how we originally planned to implement things, so we sort regressed in the design once we started implementing them. A sort of scope screep perhaps?


## Facility Mainlines

With the changes to these two systems, and a suggestion from our discord server, I went ahead and added "mainlines" which are a power cable line and fluid pipeline that travel along the road, giving you access to power and water from the "national grid". Starting out, this is no biggie, but as you start to contain more frightening anomalies it can quickly become a huge hazard to be connected to the mainlines, so you can image a grant called "Disconnect from the Grid" or something. Right now there no no major downsides to using the mainlines, but eventually when we get onto adding storyteller events, there'll be events like power cuts, and such that will make you question why you have been relying on the mainline so much.

    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/mains.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>


Below is an example of how you can use the power line to extract water from the pipeline. We'll have to balance pumps a bit since right now they output max pressure no matter what, but we'll likely want to change it to a multiplier instead.

<div style="display:flex">
    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/mains-use.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

That covers all the important stuff. I could go into more detail about these 2 systems (I didn't even get onto drains and outlets), but to spare the length of this blog, we'll have to leave it for you to find out when the game comes out!

# Changes to Generation

In my quest to improve everything about the game, I have been improving everything about this game. Shocker I know.

Underground floors now have a new shader which makes the game look a lot more polished. I love shaders!

    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">

    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff74/e2.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

Lakes are also now actually large holes in the ground filled with water, instead of fake painted bits of water. Which makes things feel a lot more cohesive, and opens up interesting exploits with the fluid pipe system.
