A belated Happy New Year to everyone who is reading this! It has certainly been a while for myself, but I decided to start work on the game again since it’s the holidays! As mentioned in the last post, I have now finished the physical damage system and have also started with seasons. Our snow falls during the in game months December to February, and now settles on the ground! An example of it can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfmau7Sl6o)

# A better weather particle emitter
With the only other special weather right now being rain and thunderstorms, I decided to make particles collide with NPCs to create a better feeling that everything was integrated. On the back of this, David had the great idea of tilting the particle emitter for our weathers, so now all rain and snow particles can interact with our NPCs and the ground. This is shown in these 2 confusing pictures underneath, where previously the particles would just float from the top of the screen down, now they are emitted on a tilted plane.

Whilst tweaks are still necessary, it has been nice having a simple task to ease my way back into the flow of things. The remaining task I’ve set myself is to add proper lightning strikes to the game – and I’ve been formulating some interesting ideas of how this could look – but will save this for another weeks discussion. Not much else to report on from my side, so hopefully I’ll have more to talk about in a few weeks time.

Thanks for taking your time to read this!
