# Kicking a Dead Pipe

> Fluid pipes now connect between floors
> Fluids in pipes prioritise flowing downwards to simulate gravity effect, but travel upwards when under pressure from beneath
> Improved performance of fluid system by switching from a cellular automata based on an array structure to a class based system using probabilities, to achieve similar behaviour
> Fluids now have different viscosities and travel at different speeds within pipes
> Multiple different types of fluid can now travel between fluid holders within the same tick. The amount of each fluid that travels is proportional to the amounts in the fluid holder it is leaving
> Fluids transfers are no longer constrained to being a multiple of 5 and can be any whole number. NPCs now only "deposit" 1 litre of sewage in toilets while using them, rather than 5 litres cos... yeah!
> Pumps now pull fluids from fluid holders before them (and still push to the fluid holders after them)
> Showers take each type and amount of fluid dispensed by a shower for calculating the hygiene score that should be given to an NPC after showering
> Fixed bug where pumps attached to water purification plant would take out wrong fluids from each output
> Fluids in pipes now make pipes heavier
> pipes now use structural integrity

# Buildings collapse with Style

(i.e. you might actually need to build foundations for your structures now!)

> structural integrity now uses cellular automata to calculate stress in real time
All tiles input their weight into yload (cos gravity).

(First Rule) Any tile with no tile beneath it transfers yload into the tile above. If there is no tile above, then it is marked for death.

(Second Rule) Tiles weigh down on tiles below them, transferring yload.

(Third Rule) Tiles distribute yload to horizontal neighbors as xload, and distribute yload to vertical neighbors below as yload.

(Fourth Rule) Tiles transfer load to the ground, where it gets divided by the ground strength.

(Last Rule) Any tile that is overstressed on X or Y load dies.


# Dwarfcorp
> added support for underground floors (negative floors)
> Underground earth composition now generates
> Added new excavation order
> Builders can now excavate ground when ordered
> Tiles can now show arbitrary progress bars
> Npcs can now fall down holes
> Npcs recieve exponential injuries based on fall distance
> multithreaded underground floor loading for increased performance when loading new floors
> only exposed underground tiles are now shown
> negative floors are now only created when tiles are exposed
> npcs will no longer excavate tiles they stand on
> npcs path to avoid holes

# When all ways are blocked, walk up
> NPCs now properly path between floors
> NPC path routes now factor in floor height in route simplication algorithm


# Containcorp through a Logistical lense
> Added logistic view
> added high, medium and low voltage cables
> added small pipes
> medium and low voltage cables, and small pipes can pass through walls
> pipes and any other tile entities can now display icon for multi-floor connections
> revamped high to medium transformer sprite
> pipe fluid bars hide between layers properly
> wire pipes and wire cables can now be marked for deconstruction when in logistics mode
> pipe fluid bars now only show in logistics mode

# Small features
> npcs can be swapped in hierarchy tree
> revamped transformer tile sprites
