# Hey Readers!

Welcome to Forensic Friday 69! It has been a long while, but we are back, and a lot has happened! We took a break from business as usual due to a lack of development from life stuff, but we still managed to do work anyways so wasn't totally necessary. Anyways, there is a lot to cover, and we don't want this blog to get ridicously long, so lets just jump straight into what we have in store: Better pipes, better structural integrity, and probably most significantly underground floors! All this comes under an effort to polish up construction side of things, which is arguably the most important aspect of the game. Well... let's get into it!

# Kicking a Dead Pipe

If you're a regular reader of our blogs, then you'll know of the hardships and battles we've had while trying to implement fluid pipes. A problem that persisted for way too many years of development for my liking, we finally reached a point where we had a solution. You can take a look at [Forensic Friday 23](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk//containcorp-blog/ff23#whats-left) and [Forensic Friday 24](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk//containcorp-blog/ff24#better-pipes) for more info, which goes into more depth about our fluid system's inner workings. Fluid was still flowing slowly (the videos in the FF23 and 24 blogs were at 10x speed), but the introduction of pumps kind of made this a low priority for us. It worked, and that was better than any other solution we'd tried before.

Fast forward roughly 450 days, and I was lying in bed, staring at the void of my bedroom ceiling. Our cellular automata was an array of fluid cells - each one containing a fluid type or empty. A random cell from the list was chosen, and transferred to a random adjacent fluid holder every iteration of the algorithm. This randomness was what made our fluid system work, where previous attempts had failed - if something was mainly empty, then you're more likely to choose an empty cell to transfer (so fluid transfers from high volume areas to low volume areas). The transfer fluid in and out cells described in FF24 had since been removed, and since we were now relying on probability alone for fluid to decide where to go, why were we modelling fluid holders with an array? The simple answer was "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". But, in a very convoluted step, due to a number of refactors inbetween, we were essentially picking a random number by choosing a random cell from an array. The problem with this? Just a lot of unnecessary array operations, which are memory and performance intensive, while providing no benefits compared to alternatives.

I've taken a step back from coding in recent months, but had a couple weeks holiday from work, which freed up some time to let my intrusive shower thoughts come to fruition. Moving the fluid system from using an array to a data centric approach, we now have a much more performance friendly solution with a couple of key benefits. Every fluid holder now has a set of key-pair values - the fluid type, and the amount of that fluid type present. Since we're no longer modelling cellular automata with arrays, we're no longer constrained to 1 cell containing 1 type of fluid (for reference, a pipe contained about 100 cells).

In gameplay terms this means that, while previously the smallest amount of fluid we could transfer was 1 cell, we can now transfer any specific number we want. This means we're no longer constrained to fluids being multiples of 5 litres (the minimum cell size). This also means in a single fluid system iteration, multiple types of fluids can be transferred between fluid holders in smaller quantities. E.g. if we wanted to transfer 15 litres of fluid from 1 pipe to another, previously we would have had to transfer 3 cells, which means a maximum of 3 different fluid types. Now, transferring 15 litres is a lot more intuitive - we can move fractional amounts of each fluid type in the same tick. So if a fluid holder contains 7 different fluids, then we can take the proportional amount of each of the 7 fluid types in the same iteration.

The result is that we now have a fluid system which is:

1. more memory efficient
 - no massive arrays holding potentially 1000s of fluid cells
2. faster computationally
 - to calculate amounts we don't have to loop through that massive array of cells, just add amounts for each unique fluid type
 - less iterations needed per game tick (from 80 to 20)
3. more scalable - we can add new properties to fluids that we couldn't previously, since before everything was limited to being a cell
 - different viscosities of fluids, allowing different fluids to travel at different speeds
 - temperatures for fluids (WIP) which will pave the way for boilers etc.
 - from a dev point of view, new fluids can be added using Unity's scriptable objects
4. more intuitive
 - no constraints on fluid cell size - you can transfer any amount, not just a multiple of 5!
 - quicker flow rate through pipes

Along with these changes, there's been some minor changes to all existing fluid holders to work with this new system, which has improved (at least in my opinion) how they work in game. Some of the most noticeable ones are:
* Pumps now pull from the fluid holder going into them, as well as pushing outwards, making them transfer fluid a lot more effectively.
* Showers now take each unique fluid type and their corresponding amounts for calculating the hygiene score that should be given to an NPC after showering. Previously, a shower output 6 fluid cells every game tick, that we then used to calculate how clean the NPC was. Therefore your shower could've had sewage in it, but by random chance you got 6 water cells, giving your NPC a 100% satisfaction score. Now proportional amounts of each fluid present are used.
* The water purification plant now separates fluids in the same proportion as they come into the plant. I.e. if you have 200L of sewage and 100L of water, then the plant will always output both sewage and water in separate outputs, in a ratio of 2:1, e.g. like 10L sewage and 5L water every tick. Previously, the water purification plant took from a number of random fluid cells, so you weren't guarenteed to have both water output and waste output consistently.

I know better than to call this a done deal - there's always something else, but I'm extremely happy with how this has worked out so far, and it's definitely a major improvement on top of what we had already!

# Fluids in a new dimension

This all nicely ties into why I was staring into my bedroom ceiling thinking about pipes (no, I don't just do that normally, I swear). In recent weeks, we've been polishing some aspects to do with multiple floors - more on that later on in this blog. Fluid pipes had been such a pain to implement, and by the time I implemented the current system, I was so desparate to move on that I never actually got around to making them connect between floors. Fast forward the 450ish days and that was the singular goal for my 2 weeks off - make pipes connect between floors. This shouldn't have taken that long, but sent me down the rabbit hole of a basic reworking of the fluid system as I just described in the last section.

However, enough of that - what's important is that pipes now connect between floors. Putting a pipe on a floor above another pipe automatically connects them together. However, this is where another change to how we simulate fluid flow was required. If a pipe is above another pipe, you would expect all the fluid inside to flow to the bottom one due to gravity. Therefore, our whole rule about "choosing a random neighbouring fluid holder to transfer to" needed to be reworked as well. I trialled a system whereby there is a greater probability that fluids will flow downwards, than sideways or upwards. This worked great but kind of lead to a bit of a headache when it came to flowing upwards. 

Over enough iterations, the probability dictates exactly where the fluid will go, so giving a greater probability to travel downwards meant that fluids ALWAYS travelled downwards. Which is fine, except when we had a pump on the bottom floor, and wanted to pump upwards with pressure. In this case, a tiny amount of fluid would go upwards, and then a larger amount would immediately try to flow back down to where it came from, meaning the fluids were kind of stuck in limbo on the ground floor. Messing around with the order of execution between entities, so that pumps always filled up the pipes before the pipes on the floor above transferred their contents back down again proved useless, since this just offset the problem by a single floor - now we had an issue transferring fluids between multiple floors without using a pump on every floor. A very simple and effective workaround ended up being that we bump up the flow upwards probability when the fluid in the pipe is above a certain threshold. I chose 90% as a threshold, but I'm sure we'll play around with this for larger fluid holders. If pipes hold 500 litres, then when the pipes reaches 450 litres, fluids in that pipe can start to flow upwards. This will still flow back down again, but since a larger quantity of fluid is now being shifted upwards in a single iteration, this gives the pumps some extra game ticks to fill up the pipe on the lower floor. 

The result is a fluid system that is multifloor, and appears to be effected by gravity, while also being able to be pumped to floors above without having to use a detailed pressure metric (which we've unsuccessfully attempted to use in a lot of failed versions of the fluid system). With a more efficient way to get the total fluid in a fluid holder (we have a memoized value), this has also opened the path for pipes using the structural integrity system - which David will talk more about next. Interestingly, fluid in a pipe increases the weight dynamically, which could cause some really cool realtime "physics" taking place.

# Buildings collapse with Style

Well, well, well. Mighty fine work there with the pipes Dillan! (Feels very weird speaking like this, since we write these blogs asynchronously so I am just talking to myself here). I have been given a nice segway into a very interesting addition to the game, and a rather random jump foward in the roadmap that I tend to occasionally do. As I started my break from Containcorp, which ultimately put a temporary pause on these blogs; and started cracking away at my master's thesis (which has become a mountain of work lately), I was consumed with the sudden urge to completely redo the structural integrity system. This came as a naturally progression from my efforts to polish up the construction a bit, and led me down a long, deep rabbit hole of structural engineering papers and obscure reddit posts. Turns out, structural integrity isn't a very well document feature in games! So the approach I went for is quite novel, however on the way there I managed to touch upon various different methods that are all quite interesting in theory. So I figured, I ought to share my process, before I show the final result. So time to commence probably the longest blog section I'll ever write.

## What came before...

The original structural integrity system was actually quite unrealistic. And sure, thats totally fine, we are just making a video game afterall. Realism doesn't always lead to good or interesting gameplay; rather can lead to the opposite: fustration! However, this is a game where NPCs need to use the toilet, so we have already crossed that "in-depth" simulation line. Anyways, I digress...

Th original system worked like this: 
1. When a tile was placed, it calculates the weight of all the tiles above it. 
2. Then it floodfills through the structure to find the nearest support point. 
3. Then it calculates the moment, which is the horizontal distance to the support * the column weight, which gives a measure of how much the support is able to... well, support it.
4. Then finally... and this is where it gets weird. It applies stress to itself based on this moment.

IT might not be immediately obvious why that last rule is nonsensical, but imagine a really big upside down L made of plastic. If an oversized lad stood on the end and jumped up and down, you' imagine the L would break at the corner, or would break at it's base. However, you wouldn't expect the L to break where the person is standing. Right? (Hopefully the illustration below helps)

[IMAGE] UPSIDE DOWN L

However with the old system, this is precisely what would happen. If you take a look at the images below, you'll see that the structures are all stressed at the extreme ends, instead of where you'd intuitively expect!

[IMAGES] Various structures

This happened to be a complete oversight, that remained so for quite a while! But no more! When I realised how unreleastic the current system was, I had to change it. So commenced my investigation into various methods of moddelling structural integrity!

## Failed Approaches

I tried various approaches to model structural integrity. The two I'll discuss was the support backpropagation approach, and the particle approach.

### The Support Backpropagation Approach

Not sure whether backpropgation is a good term to use here as its associately more strongly with machine learning. However, it makes sense to me, so hopefully it'll make sense to you! This approach was similar to the original method, but tried to tackle the main issue, which was the flow of stress toward supports was not accounted for. In this approach I tried this algorithm:

1. When a tile was placed, it calculates the weight of all the tiles above it. 
2. Then it floodfills through the structure to find the nearest support point. 
3. For each tile towards the support, accumulate weight from every other tiles column weight, and apply weight to each tile
4. Apply weight to support.

This is roughly how it worked. And it.. did not work. There were too many edge cases, and it took too much time tweaking and tinkering. So I scrapped it, and tried a different approach...

### Particle Approach

The particle approach was very novel to me. I scowered through the bins of reddit to find a 3 year old post about applying structural integirty in voxel games, and managed to find a stray comment which said, and i quote:

> It's quite easy you simply treat each voxel as a particle (with bonding and bouncing properties) however in your update simply don't apply any changes to their position and instead take the difference between their current position and their desired position and call that 'stress'.
>
> For bonding / bouncing equation i would suggest following the easy to implement and fast to calculate electron repulsion curve, for voxels just make sure your bond/bounce sink is at a distance of 1.0
>
> Enjoy
> **- u/Revolutionalredstone**

It was not easy... Sure it was easy to implement, but the results were not great. If what he said above doesn't make sense, effectively, the approach was to treat every voxel/tile in our game as a particle. Each particle interacts with neighbouring particles accoring to a single function. This function determines the magnitude of attraction and repulsion between particles at any given time.

[IMAGES] Electron repulsion curve

This function is the electron repulsion curve, and in short: Things that are close repel, things that are far attract until they are too far. 

So I went on to implement this and all I was left with was extremely unstable structures that refused to stay together when I tried to introduce gravity. This approach really only works when you simulate with really small timesteps. I am sure there could have spent a few dozen hours tinkering parameters and adding small hacks here and there to make it work, but the performance was also attrocious. So I decided to scrap it, which was unfortunate, as it had given me a taste of realtime structural integrity simulation, where the former apporach had been a oneshot "static analysis" approach that only ran when you placed a block.

[IMAGES] Unstable structures from particle approach

The realtime approach leads to a lot of interesting emergent features, such as dynamic loads (structural integrity is affected by NPCs walking around an such) and influence from external factors such as wind, rain, flooding, earthquakes etc. So I couldn't completely drop this approach. Instead I decided to do a good ol combination between the static method and this high fidelity simulation method: Cellular Automata! The simulation paradigm that can really do anything!

## What we have now: Cells!

Where fluids in pipes may have transitioned from cellular automata to probability. Structural integrity has gone full tilt into cellular automata. Cellular automata was a good fit as it allows for realtime calulcation, which lets us do cool dymanic things, but is also easy to parallelise, and easy to understand the cause and effect (since we handwrite all the rules). You can also split up the processing into seperate stages which helps divide up the calculate into easy to grasp steps; and it works a charm!

The current ruleset is as follows:

0. **(Source)** All tiles output their weight as into their Y load.

1. **(First Rule)** Any tile with no tile beneath it transfers Y load into the tile above. If there is no tile above, then it is marked for death.

2. **(Second Rule)** Tiles weigh down on tiles below them, transferring Y load.

3. **(Third Rule)** Tiles distribute Y load to horizontal neighbors as X load, and distribute Y load to vertical neighbors below as Y load.

4. **(Fourth Rule)** Tiles transfer load to the ground, where it gets divided by the ground strength.

5. **(Last Rule)** Any tile that is overloaded on X or Y load dies.

You may notice, the ground is mentioned there? Well, whilst I went on to implement the new structural integrity system, I also managed to implement underground floors too. More about that in the next section. However, this new structural integrity system integrates very nicely with the underground floors, as now, since structures are more realistic foundations are actually needed to build tall buildings.

This is because this cellular automata system is effective analogous to flowing water. Tiles within structures are like magic pipes, allowing stress to flow through them whilst constantly outputing stress, and stress flows from the top of structures to the bottom. The ground acts as a sink for stress, absorbing it. A natural consequence of this is that the surface area of ground the structure is exposed to, allows for more stress to be dissapaited, which means building foundations allow you to create a larger surface area for stress to be released (than without). Its a pretty interesting way to thing about stress and strucutral integrity!

[IMAGES] Various Structrual integrity structures

This new system also allows us to define load strength in both horizontal and vertical directions, which is analogous to shear and compressive strength. Which allows us to model a wider range of materials. For example foundation concrete has very high compressive (Y load) strength, but very weak shear (X load) strength, so its great to take the weight of buildings, but you'd really struggle to make a bridge out of it!

It will still need to go few some tweaking, but right now it works very well, and is performant enough for our needs so far. But the talk about excavating foundations brings us nicely into one of the biggest additions to the game for a long time. Underground floors!

# Dwarfcorp

Containcorp has ventured into the territory of dwarf fortress. Underground floors now generate when you make excavation orders. The ground is made up of a various composition of rocks, clays and dirt (well only one of each type for now), which will have different properties in the future, such as mining time, how much it can dissipate stress.
