# Happy New Year!

Hi, and welcome to the end of year Forensic Friday! We hope you've had a happy holiday period, and the impending post-holiday season depression hasn't kicked in yet! As usual, we have a few updates to let you know about, and then we'll jump right into a recap of 2024 (which is extremely similar to [last year](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk/containcorp-blog/ff63), since that worked so well). First thing first is some completely outside of the game developments, our own merch shop!

# Merch shop incoming

Over the last week, we've been developing our own [merch store](https://shop.plasmarcstudios.co.uk), since who wouldn't want to wear Containcorp merch?? #ad

    <div style="flex:1;padding-right:10px;">
        <img src="./forensic-friday-media/ff80/merch.png" width="100%" alt="Front page for our merch shop"/>
    </div>
</div>

Jokes aside, the merch store is close to being finished - we're just going to do some product quality tests before selling anything, since we don't have a full-time customer support agent at Plasmarc Studios, yet! This will likely take a few weeks, then we'll officially open the store. It's our first time creating anything of this sort, but everything seems to be working as intended so fingers crossed we aren't setting a random server on fire somewhere!

The merch shop will (hopefully) help us fund some future community events, general upkeep of our online presence like our website and this blog that you're reading on, some kickstarter incentives with discount codes + it's just cool having game specific merch to rep ourselves! We've previously only had merch as part of our "Field Agent" tier and higher on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/containcorp). We've always tried to be as transparent as possible that we don't expect any patrons, but if you want to help support us long term then that was the best place to do so, and in return you could get some exclusive merch + some exclusive early news about what we're up to. However, if you just want to get your hands on some physical items straight away, now you can do so!

# A year recap

# Case Closed

So that wraps up a whole year. 2024 wasn't the year of early access that we keep promising every single year, but it did result in our first pre-alpha release, and solidified our plan to enter this year's Steam next fest, which runs at the end of Feburary. This will also coincide with our Kickstarter campaign which will hopefully power us through to an early access release, sooner rather than later! 2025 will actually be the year of Containcorp (we've said it enough times that jinxing doesn't apply anymore) and we're so excited heading into the new year to actually get this show on the road!

Finally. I'd just like to say thanks to our small, but growing, community on Discord who have waited patiently as we stumbled through the last few years, all the playtesters so far who have helped us find and solve game design issues and bugs, and you for reading this! We do have some community events and competitions planned in 2025, so if that interests you, make sure to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jrWyF5yN8Z). Have a Happy New Year everyone!
