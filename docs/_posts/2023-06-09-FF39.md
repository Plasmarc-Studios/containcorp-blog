- Do Welcome

Releasing this week's blog post may be the most excited we've been sharing news. There's A LOT to get through, and most of it will change how we do everything going forwards - so strap in, this is going to be a good one. There isn't any game development news this week, but everything "outside" the game has had a massive upgrade so let's get started!

# New Website
- Mention new website
- Mention mailing list can be signed up too, but currently isn't active so you wont recieve emails, but you still end up on our list
- Mention not all links work
- Mention FAQ, can be accessed, a few modifications
- Link to website 

Firstly, the new website is now functioning and is hosted on a [brand new domain](https://containcorpgame.com/)! Having the game name in the website name makes a lot of sense, so it should be a bit easier to remember. On the new website, you'll see the links to all places Containcorp, including our to-be Steam page, Patreon, Discord and Youtube. 

If you delve further into the website, you'll see a mailing list. The mailing list isn't currently active, so you won't receive emails yet -  but you can still sign up, so you don't miss when we do put out emails! There is also an updated FAQ page in the top bar, that gives up-to-date information on the most popular questions to the best of our knowledge. The website is still very much new, and we have some dead links right now, but are working to get everything polished - if you spot any mistakes then please do let us know in the usual places.

# Anomalous Wiki V.2
- Talk about wikidot, everything early stages but its up and working, no mobile responsiveness currently
- Mention there is place to submit files
- Mention there may be issue making user accounts
- Mention choice between keeping PDFs or converting them into text content, mention links within files broken
- Link to wiki and iframe it

The new wiki page for our game is now active - you can find it [here](http://containcorp.wikidot.com/)! Hosted by Wikidot, we've been busy setting up all the pages within the wiki. This is our first time using Wikidot, so after a small learning curve, we _think_ that it's ready. On the new wiki, you can see the official documents we've made so far, and also submit new files if you have an account with Wikidot! There's a template that should load when you go to the [correct part on the website](http://containcorp.wikidot.com/create-submissions). On this template, you can insert your cool ideas and, if everything goes to plan, the pages will look amazing! Plus you can now edit your files after creating them! No more duplicate submissions :P If there are issues with submitting files then let us know, since permission settings may need tinkering.

The official documents are currently shown as PDF documents, but we are debating whether we keep them as PDFs on the wiki, or convert them into text content like the user submissions, due to issues with links between documents not working while in PDF format - we'll keep you posted on any developments here, but you can also check out the anomalies [here](http://containcorp.wikidot.com/group-1).
