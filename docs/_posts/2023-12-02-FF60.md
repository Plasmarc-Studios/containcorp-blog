# Intro
<div class="speaker"><div class="title">ðŸ“£Dillan</div></div>

Fancy seeing you lot here! It's been a while since I have started a blog post (FF53 to be precise). After a random spurt of work, I'm in a position to talk through a small portion of what's been happening this week! Getting started with the word that must not be named...

# Pipes resurfaced
<div class="speaker"><div class="title">ðŸ“£Dillan</div></div>

What else would have brought me out of a mini retirement other than pipes? After "conquering" them a while back now, changes towards tick rate optimisations had made them _slightly_ unusable. Our main problem was fluid in pipe A wouldn't get to pipe B unless the game was put on max time warp, and we waited for a little while - not game breaking - but close enough and definitely not playable. We needed what was happening to run more often, without sabotaging game performance.

A quick runthrough on possible solutions led to a fairly quick solution. Rip it up and don't look back. I'm happy to say this wasn't a rewrite, just simplifying some of our older logic, and leaning on the advantages of using a probability-based system. It wasn't always plain sailing...

However, after a little tweaking, pipes are now unbroken again (we think). Subject to some more testing and playing around, fluids now flow happily in realtime again - what a time to be alive!

Pumps are now far more powerful than they used to be, completely filling fluid holders next to them consistently.

Powerless fluid systems are now similar to fluid systems with pumps before the changes! With such large scale changes with our codebase over the last few months, regression was always going to happen - but at least this should be out of the way for the forseeable future!

# Wiki Updates
<div class="speaker"><div class="title">ðŸ“£Dillan</div></div>

While I'm here, I thought I'd just mention about some QoL updates on our [wiki](http://containcorp.wikidot.com/). Hazard Signs are now easier to navigate, since you can filter signs by name! Thanks to Jpkrus in our Discord for the suggestion!

You can find the updated page [here](http://containcorp.wikidot.com/warning-signs)!
