# Hey Readers!

Hey Readers, Welcome to the 78th instalment of Forensic Friday, suspiciously on time as well. Hmmm.... very odd! This week has been mostly a bug-fixing week, but we do actually have some non-boring news to share. This time not in the realm of code, but art. We've also spent some time revamping the steam page which was the next natural step following the website revamp we discussed [in the last Forensic Friday](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk/containcorp-blog/ff77){:target="_blank"}. The first major news is our new direction with the storytellers.


# Rethinking the storytellers

In the distant cosmos, 5 figures loom. All of reality in their grasp, all that exists, exists with their permission, and they are Gods of Storytelling; their only directive being to create a story that suits their tastes. Once mortals, now ascended, these minds beyond minds feast on drama and tragedy...

This is a very dramatic way to say we have scrapped some of the old storytellers, introduced new ones to replacement, and better figured out their personalities.

## The Old
We should first take a look at the original plans for the 5 storytellers. [Back in the Forensic Friday 40](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk/containcorp-blog/ff40#introducing-the-storytellers){:target="_blank"} we introduced 5 storyteller concepts. You can see what they were about below.

![storytellers](./forensic-friday-media/ff40/storytellers.png)
![storytellers_info](./forensic-friday-media/ff40/storytellers_info.png)

However, a lot has changed. We realised these storytellers didn't exactly work out in reality. Specifically Machiavellian Morgan and Arcane Aurelia. How exactly are we meant to make a storyteller emphasise "narrative & lore", don't they all do that? And Arcane Aurelia is a bit hard to have when you don't have any magical anomalies in the game! Maybe we could reintroduce these storytellers back for a 1.0 release, would be cool to make an extra batch of storytellers to choose from, but for now, these 2 were scrapped. So time to fill the gaps with 2 new storytellers.

## The New

The new revised roster of Storytellers is as follows:

**Serene Sophia**
> She is *chill* and relaxed providing a long time between events, and targeted towards players who just want to build. Being a synthetic humanoid she struggles with emotions and instead takes a very scientific approach to situations. She encourages experimenting and exploring mechanics in a controlled, stress-free environment.

**Natural Natasha (NEW)**
> She embodies *balance* and acts as the classic storyteller targeted to players who want a thrilling story. She's a field researcher and is full of adventurous spirit. She loves stories that have high peaks, and deep lows, but also lots of breathing room in between.

**Raging Ragnar**
> Raging Ragnar is a challenge manifest. A good story to him is triumph despite facing terrible odds. He targets players who enjoy the thrill of combat and strategic tests. He's an OSTF veteran and has a 2 headed pet called Cerbs. His rage is silent and boils within, but can explode out in a blazing fury.

**Lunatic Lucius**
> Lucius has no rules. He is a god of chaos and disorder. He'll throw anything at you, good or bad, and completely indiscriminately. It's all drama to him, and he loves drama. He targets players who enjoy unpredictability.

**Hasty Hayden (NEW)**
> Hayden's sense of time is warped, he experiences time much slower than humans. His stories are fast-paced action thrillers where there is little time to rest. He targets players who want their stories to be sprinted.

You may have noticed that Sophia is no longer the classic but rather now a *Chill* Storyteller. We didn't think it made sense for her to have "Serene" in her name and not be... well, serene; and we didn't want to rename her, so now she's just the chill storyteller. I feel like I could redesign her to make her fit that personality more, but not sure exactly what would change. I've been giving all the storytellers pets, so maybe that's something I could do. Some pet that embodies chillness, like... a monkey?? No. Clearly, I have no clue what I am doing.

# A New Storyteller: Natural Natasha
![storytellers](./forensic-friday-media/ff78/nat-fin.png)

We've had a little switch-up when it comes to the names of our storytellers. As mentioned earlier, Serene Sophia, who was previously our "default" storyteller has now been replaced by Natural Natasha.

Sophia has had a personality shift, becoming our more relaxed storyteller. Her aim is to create a more chilled playthrough, giving more time for you to solve problems.

Natasha, like Sophia before her, is designed to provide you with a balanced story, and is the way we envision the game to be played. There's an element of challenge without being overwhelmed, and you are rewarded as such for the challenges you overcome.

Accompanied by her floating cat and adorned with an array of versatile tools, Natasha is a dynamic and multifaceted storyteller. You can see her full illustration in the menu above!

# A New Storyteller: Raging Ragnar

Well, he's not new, but he does now have a sprite finally which is neat! Meet Raging Ragnar. I found him a bit harder to draw than Natasha, but I am happy with the result. I tried my best to instil a sense of silent internal rage rather than a very obvious "big angry dude". The original concept for Ragnar was actually going to be just that, and it was very boring, to be frank. I've included an image of what he was originally going to look like below:

[You can find him living in Forensic Friday 51](https://plasmarcstudios.co.uk/containcorp-blog/ff51#case-closed){:target="_blank"}

</div>

I suppose his armour was somewhat cool. We might reuse him in the future if we ever need another storyteller who would look like him, but very unlikely!

# Integrating Storytellers

Storytellers still aren't fully integrated. We haven't figured out the best way to scale difficulty or add enough tweakable settings to make each one feel really distinct. The task currently is just to spend time making difficulties match up, for example, raid group sizes, experiment failure conditions, various chances for specific events and such etc. This is all work we can do post-kickstarter. We'll keep the storyteller simple for now.

# State of Development

I suppose I might as well mention the state of development. Right now I've been spending the past week bugfixing, which has been consuming my soul and dragging it to the underworld. But we are getting their slowly but surely. I have fixed over 50 bugs in the past 7 days alone, and I'm sure I'll have to fix 50 more before the game is relatively bug free. But even then thats not a promise I can make. We could spend an entire year bug fixing, and still keep going, eventually we just have to release it and let the masses catch bugs for us (which would frankly be a lot quicker). I have just been trying to catch the most obvious game-breaking ones, and it seems like theres only 1 left, which is experiments not working! But it'll get fixed soon and my internal playtest will be over. Once thats done, the next thing is closed alpha testing, then public alpha testing.

I've encountered a lot of weird bugs I would have never imagined were in the game, its quite interesting just to find these strange bugs. On example was when character hauled items, the item would say on the floor it was picked up on. So characters had telekenisis pretty much. This also applied to hauling bodies and caused a lot of issues if characters stopped hauling before they finished the job. 

Another issue I encountered was highly specific. If characters were in beds placed on a floor higher than 0, and you went to the research screen, then exited the research screen, they would teleport to the ground floor at the same position. I'm I'm not even sure where to begin with explaining the cause behind that one! I've also encountered another bug with specifically category C floating and walking in mid-air when they are processed, but only when they arrive. Once they have een on site for some time, they return to normal... yeah well when you make a game this systems heav, you run into a lot of issues!

All this being said, the search space of bugs is likely rapidly decreasing. If I continue to average out fixing 10 bugs per day, eventually at least all major serious game flow disrupting bugs will be gone. It's a very strange feeling ingnoring minor bugs because its not on the priority. It's almost likely we are going to ship this game with known bugs! But very minor ones of course.

After my internal playtest is done, then a final optimisation step will be needed. The AI has been optimised really well, but the object ticks that govern the logic for every ojecti the game still needs some love. The game can be played and enjoyed already since the lag only starts to creeping in once you get to the start of mid-game, but ideally we'd have none until at the very least mid-late late-game. I'm confindent I'll be able to resolve it, fixing the AI lag was tremendously much harder in comparison. Or at least I think it will be.

# Small changes to raiders
During my bug fixing spree I made some small changes to Raiders. Raiders now spawn in groups instead of spawning isolated from each other in random corners of the map.

I also gave raiders very scary balaclavas! This is specifically the Anarchy Insurrectionists uniform.
