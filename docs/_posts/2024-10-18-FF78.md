We've had a little switch-up when it comes to the names of our storytellers. Serene Sophia, who was previously our "default" storyteller has now been replaced by Natasha.

Sophia has had a personality shift, becoming our more relaxed storyteller. Her aim is to create a more chilled playthrough, giving more time for you to solve problems.

Natasha, like Sophia before her, is designed to provide you with a balanced story, and is the way we envision the game to be played. There's an element of challenge without being overwhelmed, and you are rewarded as such for the challenges you overcome.

Accompanied by her floating cat and adorned with an array of versatile tools, Natasha is a dynamic and multifaceted storyteller. You can see her full illustration in the menu above!

# State of Development
- Talk about bug fixing
- mention weird bugs like hauling floor desync, floating category C etc
- talk about how internal playthrough is almost finished
- mention changes to raider spawning 
- Talk about final optimisation step needed (AI is optimal but object ticks aren't). Game can be played with lag as it only applies to large sites, but if it can get fixed it would really make things great.

# Steam Revamp
- mention new description
- mention new screenshots
- mention new short desc
- mention coming soon and segway to next section

# Fundraising on the doorstep
- talk about general plans for getting funds
- talk about youtube plans and such
- talk about posting to SCP community and all that
