We can barely remember a time before the AI overhaul but it has finally come to an end. With major and minor bugs alike, being ironed out over the week, it's _basically_ done. We're finally finished with the AI overhaul, and transferring existing systems to use it as such. 

# Prisoners expanded V3..? V4...
Maybe we should start calling this "Prisoners Expanded, Expanded", but regardless... Category C personnel have been upgraded to the new system. Extra functionality has been added to all NPCs for toilet breaks, recreational activities and socialising which of course transfers to Prisoners within your facility as well! Prisoners also have beds, so sleeping has been transferred to the new system, as well as support for bunk beds which allow for multiple Category C to sleep in at the same time.

Socialising has been reworked within Utility AI to be decentralised. This means that NPCs can choose to socialise with one other NPC at any one time, even if the other NPC is doing a different task, making the whole act of meeting up feel that little bit more organic, compared to a structured event.
