# Happy New Year!

It's now 2024, it feels weird saying after an entire year of writing 2023, but as it is every year, I'll get used to it! We hope you've all had a relaxing and fun holiday, and we are here to start the new year off with a bang! There's nothing quite like a small recap to look back at what happened last year, so let's start with that!

# A Lookback at 2023

**In July...**

> Our [steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483140/Containcorp/) finally arrived, after months of promising! We finally were able to successfully file a tax form to get it through!

> Containcorp had a rework from the ground up to support modding!

**In September...**

> I started my first full time job, and with it development stalled as holidays / Utility AI wrecked havoc on an otherwise very productive summer.

Looking back, a lot happened this year! Some things that felt like they happened years ago were only at the start of 2023 which is crazy to think about. We've got a new game website, steam page, wiki, blog website, as well as development speed being at an all time, as we race into 2024.

# The return of Mythos Monday?!

You read the title right, Mythos Mondays (formerly Mechanical Mondays) will be making a return in the new year! With our new head writer, Ruckinator, taking the lead, we hope to flesh out our wiki, and provide interesting gameplay ideas for the future! Of course, our anomaly polls will also be returning as well, so make sure you're in our Discord server to have a say in the future of the Containcorp universe!

# Case Closed

Thank for you everyone who stuck with us through 2023, and we hope to make 2024 worth your time! If you feel like there was something significant left out of our yearly recap that you'd like to see, flag us down on Discord and shout at us into submission - who knows, this case file can always be changed in post...

We'll hopefully see you in the coming weeks for the return of Containcorp development and Mythos Mondays, but until then, have fun and a Happy New Year!
