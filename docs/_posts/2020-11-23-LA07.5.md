description: "If you noticed a lack of weekly update this week, there is good reason and this is just a short explanation that we owe to all of you. Due to a sudden ramp up in my university work I haven't been on the project enough to warrant a whole blog post and will probably be busy for the next few weeks or so. With the situation similar with @𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘, we're taking our step of the accelerator where instead of putting in a few hours a day like previously, we are only getting time for a few hours a week. This post isn't to say we're stopping - because I want to stress that we aren't - just that progress won't be as fast for at the next month or so. Any major updates will still be communicated here, but please don't expect progress to be as fast as it was previously."

We're sorry we're gonna keep you all waiting but there really isn't another way we can see at the moment until holidays come up in December. 

Hope you guys understand `:)`

> tldr: We're very busy right now so progress will be a bit slower
