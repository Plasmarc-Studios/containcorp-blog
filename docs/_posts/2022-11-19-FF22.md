desc: "Welcome everyone to Forensic Friday 23! In the red corner is.... the forbidden pipes! Very scary! But the good news is that we have figured out a unique method of doing pipes that seems to work very well! ...and in the blue corner is scientists & research (geez again). Well to cut a long story short, pipes KO'd first round. Though scientists are on their way to becoming a champion. More about both contenders below `╰（‵□′）╯`"

Welcome back everyone, to another Forensic Friday. @Dil has climbed the mountain that is the development branch and has conquered it!!! `(*￣3￣)╭` <a href="/@𝕋𝔻𝟛𝟝𝟘">@𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘</a>, however, has still yet to get his chubby fingers to grip on the rocks. `(￣o￣) . z Z` My hands aren't sweaty I swear! It was the rain! `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Alas`, we bring to you good tidings, as the title below says:

# Slogging Finished

The title says it all really. Prisoners are now implemented within the game as much as we planned, with a couple little things to finish. Rather than boring with the same details as last couple weeks, the overview is that some mechanics that we want to implement for prisoners aren't possible right now (due to relying on other things on our roadmap) will be done at a later time in 1 swoop. Examples are organised escapes, or attacking guards (which also don't exist right now). Therefore someday down the road there'll be a Category-C-Extended blog post!

After dotting the i's and crossing the t's, I'll be starting p̶̚̕í̷̾p̷̐͐e̵̽̀s̵̐́.......... FUN `:)` With a fresh mindset we're confident we have a method in place that should work (it's going to involve the flow method we discussed in [Forensic Friday 17](/ff17), so fingers crossed!

# Case Closed

Anyways, though this is case is a short one, things are about to get a great deal more interesting. So something to look forward too!
