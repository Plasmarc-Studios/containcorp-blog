It has finally arrived. The coveted [steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483140/Containcorp/) in all its glory is open to the masses! We've already written a lot about what we've been doing towards the steam page, but now you can check it out for yourself and obviously wishlist it...right? Add onto the fact that we're back at full developer capacity after all the holiday shenanigans (see directly below), and the future is looking bright!

# Steam Page up and running

Again, not to keep flogging a dead horse, but our steam page has now been approved which you can find [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483140/Containcorp/). This will mark the start of our push towards more marketing and expanding the server, with more content and lore heavy material on the way, so hopefully we'll see some good results in the coming months. In the meantime, have a look through and tell your family, friends, pets and enemies. Meanwhile, everything is totally under control as seen by our feedback report!

# Anomaly Poll Winner

Speaking of Lore Heavy material, the winner for the anomaly poll this week is S-0121 - "Void Brain Disorder".

As a reminder, "Void Brain Disorder" is a disorder whereby instead of brain there is void. Void mechanisms and brain Hyperobject are the hallmarks of this disease. Surface plane encoding and localised event horizon lead to a bad singularity. Alongside the doctor's note is a box of pills assumed to be a temporary treatment to this disorder. When people come into proximity to the note, they will start to feel the effects of void brain disorder, which causes severe degregation in brain function, slowly reducing mental capacity until people become horrifically unitelligent.

We'll be busy at work writing this up in the coming week, so keep your eyes peeled on our discord server in 2 Mondays time!
