After 825 days since the first Forensic Friday, we've reached quite a significant landmark, Forensic Friday 50! While Forensic Friday is now a weekly blog, it wasn't always this way, and during inconsistent schedules and many multi-month spanning hiatuses, we appreciate everyone one who has remained supportive and engaged with our game's progress, new and old! 

First and foremost let's get into the nitty gritty for what we've been up to this week, before going on a trip down memory lane, looking back at the Forensic Fridays that have preceded this!
