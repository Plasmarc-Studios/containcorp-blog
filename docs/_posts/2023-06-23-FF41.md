Welcome, all, to Forensic Friday 41! As usual, we'll go through everything we've been up to this week game development wise, along with a few additions such as the Anomaly of the Week poll winner, as well as progress on our new steam page! Let's get the anomaly of the week out of the way first...

# Anomaly of the Week

This week's *"Anomaly of the Week"*, winning by a narrow margin is...*drumroll*... 

 **S-0257 - "Deer in management"**

S-0257 is a humanoid individual with a defining characteristic of a deer's head instead of a normal head. Despite this, S-0257 acts normally and is able to produce human words and sounds. S-0257 refers to itself as Dr. Deers. S-0257 wears a uniform similar to corporation scientist uniforms except being a color level not part of the corporation.

Following on from our Mechnical Monday (MM) blog post about our new schedule for MMs, we'll spend the next week working on the Anomaly PDF document for S-0257, and will publish it in the next Mechnical Monday in just over a week (hopefully 03/06/23 if we are not slacking).

# Finally... a Steam Page

# Game Development Updates

Lastly, the actual meat-and-potatoes for this whole project - the actual game development.

## Prisoners Expanded Completed

This week brought to a close "Prisoners Expanded" on our roadmap, which has actually been going since February due to the quirks of having exams between then and now. This is still ahead of schedule so that's always good, and we've had time to add a few optional extras!

All NPCs have 4 types of "Job" that they can be assigned in our NPC scheduler on an hourly basis - `Work, Eat, Recreation and Rest`. With eating still to be done in the future, for now Category Cs have defined behaviour for all other Job types. 

During `work`, Category C will stay in their cell, which requires a bed, toilet and jail door as a minimum requirement.  During `recreation`, Category C will do a variety of tasks. If you make a `prison yard` region, Category Cs will take time to go and hang out, socialising with other prisoners they are on friendly terms with. They will also attempt to shower at the start of recreation if they are too dirty. During `rest`, Category Cs will return to their cell, and go to sleep in their bed.

Complementing sleeping, there is a new type of bed - bunk beds! Bunk beds function in the same way that normal beds do, with the only difference being that you can house 2 people in a smaller form factor.

# Case Closed

And there goes another Forensic Friday. Obviously, the headline news about the steam page is the most exciting part, but it's still good to see progress on game development being made, and being ahead of schedule is always a nice feeling.

That'll do it for this week. Thanks for taking the time to read and we'll see you next Friday!
