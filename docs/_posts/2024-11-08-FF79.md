# Hey Readers!

Hiya everyone! Let's start with the headline. Containcorp is playable ðŸŽŠ After a journey spanning over 4 years (which definitely could've been **A LOT** shorter with hindsight) we've finally put something out that people can experience. This will probably be one of those milestone blogs that we'll come back to later on to reminisce about when we finally released something!

Over the past week we've been giving out the first playable build of our game to playtesters within our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jrWyF5yN8Z). More information on how to become a playtester can be found later on in this blog, so if it is something you would be interested in trying, then sign up to get on the waiting list!

# Building for Steam

-   Complexities of how our game needs to be installed (due to technical oversights)
-   the crazy solution we came up with with exe, linked junction files etc
-   cemeting the fact that we will probably only ever support windows unless get enough interest to justify supporting other platforms

# Pre-alpha Release

-   Confusing with pre-alpha vs alpha and what prealpha acc is/when we are officially in alpha
-   Plans with how we will organise stuff etc
-   when a more open releas will happen

<!-- This only realy answers the 2nd bullet point, feel free to flesh it out please. running a bit short on time, soz -->

For now, we're in the closed pre-alpha testing phase, where we're giving out Steam keys to selected testers within our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jrWyF5yN8Z). Right now we're averaging about 5 new testers a day, and this is the plan for the new couple weeks when, eventually, everyone who wants a key will have gotten one. If you would like to sign up, then make sure you've joined our Discord, and fill out [the form](https://forms.gle/GYPos3dC1EUCVijV9). We're looking for a wide range of testers, so please fill out the form truthfully - we're not excluding anyone depending on their answers! You'd be surprised how many people we have willing to playtest that have no prior experience with similar games ðŸ˜‰ Also make sure that you have your Discord dms are open to receive messages, since we'll contact you privately with the key and instructions - thank you!
