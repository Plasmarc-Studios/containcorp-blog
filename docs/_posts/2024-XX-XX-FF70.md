# Hey Readers!

Welcome to Forensic Friday 70. It's honestly insane we got this far, 70 is a big number! Though our readership may not be huge, these blogs have gone a long way in helping us stay consistent and ontop of development. Regardless of whether the game finds a playerbase or not, when we get this game done. It'll be a great achievement for us. Hopefully that time is soon! Though the definition of done is a blurred one, but just completing the roadmap itself would be a greta achievement for us! Anyways, this Forensic Friday, we are tying up loose ends with Category C onboarding features as we push forward (well both forward and backwards actually, but thats beside the point) towards the end of the roadmap.

# Wandering and Stargazing
- briefly mention how npcs wander around when idle again

# Flooding 
- fix issue with cellular automata rules running on each water cell, instead of all
- new visuals which make it feel more integrated
- interacts with rain (but might be removed since its negligible)
- mention how weather systems will be redone when planet systems come about
- small future features left such as putting out fires, npcs drowning etc
- fire spread would need redoing too! (to use cellular automata)


# Clearance UI
- can view, define and change clearance stuff
- does jason want to write this?


# Onboarding Category Cs
- onboarding works
- new waiting room
- site region events are instant
- issues with NPC AI being fleshed out


# Issues
- new issues ui, shows problems with systems etc
- eventually you'll be able to click on an issue and ping to where it is

# Game Design Talk

- Vision
- Agency
- Game Feel
