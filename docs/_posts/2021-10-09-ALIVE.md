The answer to this is unfortunately not much, and not enough to warrant a whole blog post. In fact, at least for me, all I did was struggle implementing a fluid system for a couple days before university hit. Last year, with the whole covid-19 situation and university being online, both @𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘  and I had time to spend working on the game. We didn’t exactly have a tonne of time but could dedicate a good few hours a week whilst still maintaining studies (which were considerably easier as we were both 1st years) and also socialising as much as were possible during lockdown."

Hi everyone! It’s been over a month since our last update blog and you may be wondering about what’s been happening over the last couple weeks. The answer to this is unfortunately not much, and not enough to warrant a whole blog post. In fact, at least for me, all I did was struggle implementing a fluid system for a couple days before university hit. Last year, with the whole covid-19 situation and university being online, both @𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘  and I had time to spend working on the game. We didn’t exactly have a tonne of time but could dedicate a good few hours a week whilst still maintaining studies (which were considerably easier as we were both 1st years) and also socialising as much as were possible during lockdown.

And that brings us up to date now. We’ve both started 2nd year, but are in the unique situation where it’s our first time being in person attending lectures etc. With the joys of being able to attend lectures in pjs now a distant memory, the days just feel that tiny bit shorter. After getting home, most days I’m shattered, and @𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘  feels the same. Therefore, we can’t commit any time regularly to work on the game right now. This was expected but we understand any frustrations you may have, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.

I’d like to stress that we are not giving up on the game (especially after dedicating the whole of Summer full time!). However, the only times that we’d be able to dedicate regular time to the game would probably be during holidays, but this would be balanced with studies etc. We will update the blog accordingly with things being done, and we’ll still be active in the discord as well. 

This isn't ideal for us either but we hope to work on this again asap

> P.S. This whole statement only applies to me and @𝕋 𝔻 𝟛 𝟝 𝟘  as well. We’ll be giving a brief to @Sharon about her roles for her job in the coming week, and she may be working on the game. If she does, I’m sure she can write a blog post about all the things she’s up to!
